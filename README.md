## GitHub Classroom test run

### Downloading the demo assignment
Clone the assigment repository which was created for you / your team. 
```
git clone https://github.com/hertie-data-science-lab/Test-Lab-1
```
If you feel more comfortable using git UI tools instead of the command line, feel free to use them.

### Dependency management

We recommend to use conda and pip for dependency management and setup an isolated conda environment for every Python assignment and project. This helps to cleanly management dependencies and makes it easier for other people to reproduce your results.

A conda environment with the specified dependencies can be created with:
```
conda create --name <some-name> --file requirements.txt
```

### Keras demo

Feel free to play around with the Keras CNN example and see how changing the learning rate, number of training samples, bach size, and epochs will affect the learning process.


### Submitting your work

Please implement the `lcm()` function in implement_me.py and then commit and push your changes.

If you use git on the command line, it works as follows:
```
git add <file to be added>
git commit -m <commit msg - briefly describe your change>
git push
```

Open your repository on GitHub and check that your commit is there.
